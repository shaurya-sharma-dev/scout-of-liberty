## Quickstart for Desktop Version
1. Download Python 3.12, if you don't already have it. (Make sure it is the correct version!)
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder with all of the project code files.
3. Run `pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt`. On some platforms, you may have to run `pip3 install --no-deps -r requirements.txt` instead.
    - If the command fails on Linux and triggers an `externally-managed-environment` error, you should create and activate a virtual environment before re-running the command.
    - To create and activate a virtual environment, run the following:<br>
    `python3 -m venv venv      # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'`<br>
    `source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment named  'venv'`
4. Run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` (depends on platform) in order to run the game.

## Quickstart for Web Version
1. Download Python 3.12, if you don't already have it. (Make sure it is the correct version!)
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder with all of the project code files.
3. Run `python -m http.server` or `python3 -m http.server` (depends on platform) in order to host the web version locally (installing the dependencies is not needed since PyScript does that in the browser). Make sure that port 8000 is open before running the command.
4. Open localhost:8000 to play the game!
